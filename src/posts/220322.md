## Why I made this app

Everything including, why I made this app, the design of this app and showcase
is here -> https://leomotors.github.io/you-are-a-failure/

## The process

The process of publishing app to Microsoft Store is very simple!
Based on my first experience, it took about an hour to get your app running,
if nothing gone wrong.

First, you need money, 19$ to register for an account. After that you can publish
as many app as you want. And it is exactly what I will do next!

Next you upload your app, put some informations and wait.

And that's it, I don't know what to write here. There is barely nothing to write ðŸ˜‚
