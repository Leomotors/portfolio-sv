## Tips & Guide

Some ~~few~~ Technical stuff is mentioned in [previous post](/blog/firstapptomsstore)

Let's talk about something useful and uncovered in previous short post,
like *how I learn to make the UWP WinUI2 C# .NET app*

Mainly, I read documentations and watch various youtube videos. It is very hard
to find specific complete course for this, especially in easy to comprehend,
your native language.

Microsoft did provide a very good documents, which for me is a bit confusing for
starter. It took me many many attempts to learn WinUI.

For anyone wishing to create a WinUI app. Here is the things you need to learn

- C#: I recommend C# for starter because it is easier to write than C++ (yes, why?)

- Xaml Syntax: It is invented since WPF which is ten years ago. It remained pretty
much the same throughout the years. Some WPF questions in StackOverflow can still help you
resolving your problems in UWP or Windows App SDK. Understanding the Xaml Syntax is a MUST!

- Xaml Controls Gallery is the must-have app for creating WinUI2 app

- Try viewing source code of apps like Xaml Controls Gallery or DevToys to see how
they done their app. *and maybe yeet their code*

- Keywords when searching google: UWP (If you are doing UWP)

Good Luck!
